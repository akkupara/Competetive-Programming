1.) DP on stocks:

-->You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

-->You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.
  
  
 Example 1:

Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
  
  
  
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int mini = prices[0];
        int profit = INT_MIN;
        int n = prices.size();
        
        for(int i=0; i < n; i++)
        {
            mini = min(mini, prices[i]);//mini to keep track min value as we traverse thru the array
            int cost = prices[i] - mini;//subtract mini with each element of the array iteratively
            profit = max(profit, cost);//check which gives the largest value
        }
        return profit;
        
     
        
    }
};




2.) Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II


--> On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock.
--> You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time.
--> you cannot buy another stock before selling the stock you had.
--> However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day.

3.) Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III


--> Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions
--> same as the above problem, but except we introduce cap variable (no of transaction) and solve accordingly
--> can also be solved using n*4 dp table using transaction number(that is when trans no is even it is buy and when it is odd, it is sell) with the same recurrece

Example 1:

Input: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
Example 2:

Input: prices = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
Example 3:

Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.

6.) Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

--> same as stocks 2 but for each transaction when it is complete, you will have to pay a transation fee
